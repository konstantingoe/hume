Description: Given some (high-dimensional) data set where both discrete and continuous variables are present,
             the package offers functionality in order to estimate an undirected graph. It is assumed that all 
             discrete variables are ordinal. If nominal variables (where the levels are unordered) are present,
             the user is asked to form a dummy system.     Discrete variables are assumed to have some latent continuous analogs,
             that are some monotone transformed version of standard Gaussians. The functions `mixed.graph.gauss()` and `mixed.graph.nonpara()` 
             estimate the latent precision matrix of these (transformed) continuous variables where the former assumes
             no transformation (latent Gaussian model) and the latter assumes monotone and differentiable transformation functions
             (latent Gaussian copula model).    The latter is more general and should always be used except for when the user 
             knows that the latent variables are Gaussian (this will almost never be the case).
