\title{Mixed Graph Estimation under Nonparanormal assumption}
\usage{
mixed.graph.nonpara(data = data, verbose = T, nlam = 50, param = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data set of dimension \eqn{n \times d}}

\item{verbose}{Prints some useful information, defaults to `TRUE`}

\item{nlam}{Length of the glasso path. Default is 50}

\item{param}{Value to which the additional dimensionality penalty in the eBIC should be set. Default is .1}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements is returned:
\itemize{
  \item Estimated Precision Matrix - The estimated precision matrix. If `partial = TRUE` the entries correspond to partial correlations.
  \item Adjacency Matrix - The corresponding adjacency matrix that encodes the undirected graph.
  \item Sample Correlation Matrix - The sample correlation matrix plugged into the glasso routine.
  \item Edgenumber - The number of edges in the graph
  \item Max Degree - The largest number of connections across all nodes in the graph.
  \item initial_mat_singular - Boolean whether correlation matrix was singular and had to be transformed to the pd-cone.
}
}
\description{
Estimates precision matrix and adjacency matrix, i.e. the undirected graph,
given a (potentially high dimensional) data set that contains discrete and continuous variables.
If nominal variables are present, they should be transformed to a dummy system.
